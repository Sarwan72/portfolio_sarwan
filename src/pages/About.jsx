            Hello! I'm{" "}
            <span className="text-pink-400 font-semibold">Sarwan Kumar</span>,
            currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at
            Bundelkhand Institute of Engineering and Technology (BIET), Jhansi.
            I expect to graduate in Spring 2026.{" "}

            As a passionate MERN Stack Developer, I enjoy building modern,
            responsive, and scalable web applications. I focus on turning
            complex ideas into simple, functional, and user-friendly digital
            experiences.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Over the course of my studies, I’ve worked on projects like an
            E-commerce Website, Uber Clone, and an Advertisement Page, where I
            explored technologies such as
            <span className="text-yellow-400">
              {" "}
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
            </span>{" "}
            and<span className="text-yellow-400"> Tailwind CSS</span>. These
            experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also
            strengthened my ability to solve problems and think creatively.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            My aim is to craft solutions that are efficient, engaging, and
            impactful — bridging the gap between functionality and great user
            experience.
